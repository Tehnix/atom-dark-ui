# Clean Atom Dark UI theme

Cleaner and simpler interface, derived from the default dark theme for Atom.

What's different?
* Line heights are changed, with the aim to look closer to TextMates
* Tabs are now square, a bit smaller and closer together
* The tree-view is smaller and the padding is also a bit smaller

A preview of how it looks,
